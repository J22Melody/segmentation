# # How2Sign (ASL) — assessment
#
# **Conclusion: not usable for sign-level segmentation.** Recorded here so we do
# not re-investigate it later. It remains interesting for *phrase*-level work.
#
# Two independent reasons:
#
# 1. **The gloss annotation is not timed per sign.** The CVPR 2021 paper is
#    careful about this — ELAN tiers are "time-aligned to the video files, giving
#    us the start and end boundaries of **each sentence** and producing what we
#    call the **sentence boundaries**". Glosses are transcribed as a sequence;
#    per-gloss start/end times are never claimed. `Table 2` reports statistics
#    exhaustively and contains **no gloss row at all** — no gloss count, no gloss
#    vocabulary, no glossed hours.
# 2. **The glosses were never released.** The download section of
#    <https://how2sign.github.io/> covers RGB video, keypoints and English
#    translations, and states "This section is under construction. We will be
#    releasing the other modalities soon!". GitHub issue
#    [#5 "How can I get the gloss annotations for each sentences?"](https://github.com/how2sign/how2sign.github.io/issues/5)
#    was filed in December 2021 and is still open and unassigned.
#
# So How2Sign offers sentence boundaries plus a gloss *sequence* — the same shape
# as MEDIAPI-SKEL, and the same limitation. See `../mediapi_skel/`.

#
# > ### The `eaf_files` are NOT gold annotation
# >
# > `sentence_level/*/rgb_front/eaf_files/` contains ~35k `.eaf` files with `SIGN`
# > and `SENTENCE` tiers, which looks like exactly what we want. It is not.
# > Their header reads `AUTHOR="sign-langauge-processing/transcription"`, dated
# > 2024-06-01, and every `ANNOTATION_VALUE` is **empty** — boundaries with no
# > gloss labels. These are **outputs of the 2023 segmentation model**, the same
# > pipeline we run in `../signsuisse/run_2023_segmentation.py`, not human
# > annotation. `video_level/segmentation/` similarly holds an 81-directory
# > `E4s-1_<b>_<o>` threshold sweep (9x9 grid, 10-90), i.e. earlier decoding
# > experiments.

# > Treating these as ground truth would mean evaluating the model against itself.

# ## Verdict and notes
#
# - **Do not use for sign-level segmentation.** No per-sign timings exist, and the
#   glosses are not obtainable even if they did.
# - **Potentially useful for phrase-level segmentation**, where sentence
#   boundaries are exactly the right label — but only if the sentence-boundary
#   CSVs are downloaded; our local copy has none.
# - **Notable for fingerspelling.** ~20% of the vocabulary is fingerspelled, which
#   is high, and relevant to that phenomenon in the proposal — though again,
#   without per-sign timings it cannot support fingerspelling *segmentation*.
# - **Sentence-level data is ready to use** if we want phrase segmentation:
#   `sentence_level/*/rgb_front/` has the clips and pose estimation, and
#   `text/en/raw_text` the English sentences, alongside `video_level/
#   subtitles_manual` (2,528 hand-checked `.vtt`). Note manual, auto and
#   audio-derived subtitles are all present — pick deliberately, they are not
#   equivalent.
# - **Mixed frame rates** (23.976 / 24 / 60 fps in a sample of the parsign cache),
#   so nothing here should assume a constant fps.
# - **An 81-point threshold sweep already exists** in `video_level/segmentation/`
#   from earlier work. Useful as a reference for decoding behaviour on ASL, and a
#   reminder that these are predictions, not labels.
# - The `parsign` cache belongs to another project; the main copy is shared group
#   space. Do not modify either in place — copy out if needed.
